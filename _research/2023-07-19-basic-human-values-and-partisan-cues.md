excerpt: Are human values durable in a polarized political world? Scholars have long believed that humans hold durable and universal value structure, called the Basic Human Values that not only shape personal preferences, but also constrains and shapes political preferences at the same time. However, scholars have yet to test the reciprocal effects of politics on basic human values. This paper tests the conventional wisdom on human values' durability for the first time, using partisan cues. Using survey experiments, I find that partisans adjust their value expressions when they receive party cues more favorably when given in-party cues and refrain from values that are prompted with out-party cues. Moreover, I show that Democrats and Republicans value positions almost flip flop depending on whether they receive in-party cue or out-party cue. Thus, this paper gives the first evidence that partisan cues in the polarized American context, can even shift human value positions, and suggest the possibility of a more genuine change in value if people are consistently exposed to such party cues.

Scholars have long believed that humans hold durable and universal value structure, and social psychologists have named it the Basic Human Values. In a polarized world, is it still true that basic human values are durable? In this paper, I test durability of basic human values using various partisan and party leader cues. I show that basic human value positions shift when partisans receive party cues, and I also show that out-party cues are stronger than in-party cues, and party leader cues are stronger than partisan cues. This findings show that when partisans are met with strong party cues, they are willing to shift their value expressions according to their party identity. This is the first experimental study to test the assumption of human value’s durability.
