excerpt: 'In the United States, the language of traditional family values took root in the Religious
Right movement of the 1970s. Conservative white religious leaders constructed a
specific moral language and introduced it to American politics. The Republican Party
used the language of traditional values to appeal to mobilize conservative Christians
and appeal to culturally conservative whites more broadly. By contrast, conservative
Christian leaders and Republican politicians did not use the language of traditional
family values to appeal to Black or Hispanic Americans. We posit that in response
whites alone have developed fully crystallized beliefs about traditional family values. By
contrast, basic human values (Schwartz 1992) emerge in response to universal needs
that confront all individuals in all groups and societies. Human values express these
needs in the form of cognitive goals. Schwartzâ€™s theory suggests that members of
different racial and ethnic groups have developed universal moral values that are
exogenous to politics. We test these claims with data from four national surveys. We
apply measurement modeling techniques to the ANES moral traditionalism and
Schwartz conservation items in samples of whites, Blacks, and Hispanics. We find that
whites alone express fully structured beliefs about traditional family values; and that
whites, Blacks, and Hispanics express fully structured beliefs about tradition,
conformity, and social change that transcend politics.
